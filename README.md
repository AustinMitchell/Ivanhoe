# Ivanhoe

Based on the card game Ivanhoe from GMT Games. Written in Java using SimpleGUI_V2 (another library in my repositories) as the UI engine.

Networking and GUI were developed by me, everything else developed by Nicholas Rivard and Ahmed Abdeghani

To start it up,  instantiate an instance of Server and 2 to 5 instances of IvanhoeApp, depending on the number of players desired.
